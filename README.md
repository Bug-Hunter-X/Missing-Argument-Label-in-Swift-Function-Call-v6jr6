# Missing Argument Label in Swift Function Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include argument labels when calling a function.

The `bug.swift` file shows an incorrect function call, leading to a compiler error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected version.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.swift` in Xcode.
3. Try to build and run the project.  You will get a compile-time error.

## Solution:
Ensure you include all argument labels when calling functions in Swift.
